# strava-quick-view
Use the Strava API to view your activities at a glance.

This shiny app is in progress, and currently includes calendar of past activities, with clicking on an activity bringing up additional details.

It also includes an 'Additional Insights' tab, which shows additional charts not available in the current version of Strava.

Future enhancements will include:
- Hosting on GitHub Pages.
- A better integration with Shiny's oauth, allowing users to sign in and view their own activities.
- More charts in the 'Additional Insights' tab.
- Smoother transitions and cleaner ways to view multiple activities in the (right-side) details pane.
- Reusable components and consistent styling throughout the app.
- Additional details for each activity, with precise links to Strava when information is better viewed there.
- Unit tests, when applicable.
