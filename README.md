# strava-quick-view
Use the Strava API to view your activities at a glance.

This shiny app is in progress, and currently includes calendar of past activities, with clicking on an activity bringing up additional details.

Future enhancements will include:
- Hosting on GitHub Pages.
- A better integration with Shiny's oauth, allowing users to sign in and view their own activities.
- Additional charts not available in the current version of Strava.
- Smoother transitions and cleaner ways to view multiple activities in the (right-side) details pane.
- Reusable components and consistent styling throughout the app.
- Additional details for each activity, with precise links to Strava when information is better viewed there.
- Unit tests, when applicable.
